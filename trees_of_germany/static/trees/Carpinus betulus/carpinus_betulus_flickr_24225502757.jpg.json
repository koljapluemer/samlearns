    "description": "This distinctive tree stands out by the shape that gives it its name ‘fastigiata’ which means that the branches grow more upwards than outwards. In full leaf during the summer, this characteristic isn’t immediately apparent but return in winter and you’ll see the dense bare branches shoot upwards quite strikingly.\n\nThis mature specimen is clearly very happy and thriving in this peaceful location. Sit on the bench beneath it in late summer to appreciate the hop-like fruit clusters and then in autumn to see its ribbed green leaves change to a bright yellow.\n\n<a href=\"http://uom.treetrail.co.uk/#FastigiateHornbeam\" rel=\"nofollow\">uom.treetrail.co.uk/#FastigiateHornbeam</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpinus_betulus\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpinus_betulus</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fastigiate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fastigiate</a>",
