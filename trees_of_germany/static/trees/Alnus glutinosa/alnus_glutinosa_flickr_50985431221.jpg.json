    "description": "Common Alder (Alnus glutinosa)\n\nMale flowers are the big catkins hanging down and the female flowers are little ones at the top. \n\nThese alders grow along the river beside me (the river is in background in this picture). The roots are largely under the water level especially during the winter but that seems to suit them just fine.\n\nCamera Obscura - Honey in the sun\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU42cXy608o\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU42cXy608o</a>",
