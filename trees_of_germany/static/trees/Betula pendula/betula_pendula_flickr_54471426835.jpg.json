    "description": "The intertwined roots of two birches (Betula pendula) next to Myrstigen hiking trail in Brastad, Lysekil Municipality, Sweden. The birches grow in a rest and grilling area with benches. Being of the right height, the roots are often used as an extra sitting place, and they get scuffed and polished regularly by the people using them. The area is also on a slope, so it gets washed free of debris as soon as it rains. This leaves the roots more exposed than other√¢s in the forest, and they look like shiny veins of the forest.",
