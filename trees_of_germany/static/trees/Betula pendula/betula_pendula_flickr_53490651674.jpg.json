    "description": "Blackbird (Turdus merula) in a frosty birch (Betula pendula) in winter in Tuntorp, Brastad, Lysekil Municipality, Sweden. After days of very strong winds, when all the snow was blown from trees and structures, came a few days of calm and cold weather. This formed hoar frost on all surfaces and on the third day, it had accumulated into a thick layer on everything. The only snow was on the ground, so all the &quot;white&quot; covering trees, plants and structures in the photo is hoar frost. And then the fog came.",
