    "description": "Frosty fog on birches (Betula pendula) in winter in Tuntorp, Brastad, Lysekil Municipality, Sweden. After days of very strong winds, when all the snow was blown from trees and structures, came a few days of calm and cold weather. This formed hoar frost on all surfaces and on the third day, it had accumulated into a thick layer on everything. The only snow was on the ground, so all the &quot;white&quot; covering trees, plants and structures in the photo is hoar frost. And then the fog came.",
