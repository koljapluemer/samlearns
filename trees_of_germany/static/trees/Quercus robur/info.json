    "description": "At first, I couldn't think of anything for letter Q. Then I remembered the oak trees are in the genus <i>Quercus</i>! Perfect, I thought. The <i>Quercus robur</i> trees in the woods behind my house are just coming back to life and their fresh leaves are beautiful. I just had to go out at the right moment, when the sun was shining after the rain.\n\nAnd now I will need to take a little break from this series. I'm going to be out for the weekend, and I don't have anything yet for the next letters. I should be back sometime next week with letter R. Thanks to everyone who has been following this project, and I wish you all a wonderful weekend!",
