    "description": "Small lappet moth (Phyllodesma ilicifolia) on ivy (Hedera helix (cultivated)) on a wall clad with wooden planking painted grey (as seen here). The white fluff is aspen seeds (Populus tremula). Aspen seeds need bare mineral soil to germinate, so aspens prefer to go to seed after forest fires. The extremely hot 2018 summer, caused almost all aspens in Sweden to go to seed in 2019, and for a couple of weeks the whole country was covered with white fluff [1]. Focus stacked from 6 photos. An external x4 Hoya macro lens was used.\n-\nI'm transferring the photos from my old Flickr account to this.",
