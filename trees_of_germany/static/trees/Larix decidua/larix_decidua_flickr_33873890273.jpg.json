    "description": "When newly unfurled in spring, Larch needles are small and a delicate shade of green. They are soft to the touch and quite different from most other conifer.\n\nLarch is a conifer but also deciduous, loosing its needles every autumn. There aren't many other deciduous conifers - only 4 other genera, most of them rare.\n\nEuropean Larch (<i>Larix decidua</i>) isn't native; it was introduced to the UK in the 1600s, originating in the European Alps.\n\nThe larches were planted for decorative effect around Tarn Hows in the Lake District but have seeded themselves hither and thither. This one is growing vigorously by the shore of the tarn.\n\nGotta love a larch tree.",
