    "description": "Larix decidua 'Pretty Carole' (Dennis Groh, MI 1993) 2019 photo - Common Name: Weeping Eurorean Larch, Size at 10 years: 3x3ft., light green foliage that turns straw yellow before being shed in the fall, USDA Hardiness Zone x, In Garden Bed HR-U for 8.8 YEARS (HLG). Planted in 2011.\n\nACS: Larix decidua 'Pretty Carole' is a symmetrical, flattened globose, selection of European larch with typical bright, light green foliage that turns straw yellow before being shed in the fall. After 10 years of growth, a mature specimen will measure 3 feet (1 m) tall and wide, an annual growth rate of 3 to 4 inches (7.5 - 10 cm)\n\nThis cultivar originated as a seedling selected in 1993 by Randy Dykstra and Chub Harper from seed sourced from the original L. decidua 'Lanark' broom. Chub Harper of Moline, Illinois gave a witch's broom seedling from L decidua 'Lanark' to Dennis Groh of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, saying that he and Randy had too many of these seedlings on hand to &quot;baby sit.&quot; After growing it in his garden for a number of years, Dennis recognized this plant as a superior, very dwarf selection of this species. Over time it has been grafted and these plants have been distributed to other collectors and arboreta.\n\nThe plant was provisionally named 'Dennis Groh' and can occasionally be found listed under that name. In 2004, Dennis told Chub that he was interested in getting it propagated and worked with him to establish a permanent name. At first Dennis wanted to call it 'Chub's Gift,' but Chub balked at the idea, saying that he already had enough plants named for him. Rather he suggested renaming it, 'Pretty Carole' in honor of Dennis Groh's wife. The plant itself echos its namesake. It makes an excellent small garden plant and one that stays in scale with the surroundings.\n\nLocation: Michigan State University, Hidden Lake Gardens, Tipton, MI.
