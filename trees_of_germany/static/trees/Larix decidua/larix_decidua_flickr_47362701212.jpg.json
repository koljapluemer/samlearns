    "description": "Larix kaempferi 'Pendula', 2019 photo, Common Name: Larch, Size: #Conifer, Blue green, USDA Hardiness Zone 4, Michigan Bloom Month x, In Garden Bed HR-D for 43.1 YEARS (HLG). Planted in 1976.\n\nAmerican Conifer Society: Larix kaempferi ‘Pendula’ is an amorphous, strictly weeping selection of Japanese larch that will take on many forms depending on training and where the graft was placed on the understock. Unless pruned, branches will eventually weep to the ground and form a ground cover. The shoots are a rich to reddish pink on the new growth, leaves are blue-green to glaucous. The small cones when present are distinctive with reflexed scales. \n\nThis is an old cultivar that has been a mainstay of the nursery trade since the late 1800s. It was first described in Ludwig Bessner’s botanical texts and thought to have been introduced by Hermann A. Hesse Nursery, Weener-on-Ems, Germany. This plant is habitually and improperly labeled and sold in the USA as Larix decidua ‘Pendula.\n\n’MSU Hidden Lake Gardens, Harper Collection of Rare &amp; Dwarf Conifers\n\n  #Larix #Larch\n\n <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=50697352%40N00&amp;sort=date-posted-desc&amp;text=Larix%20kaempferi%20'Pendula'\">www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=50697352%40N00&amp;sort=da...</a>",
