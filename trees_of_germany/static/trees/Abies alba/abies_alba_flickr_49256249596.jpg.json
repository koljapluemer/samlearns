    "description": "Abies alba 'Pendula' () 2019 photo - Common Name: Weeping European Silver Fir, Size at 10 years: 8x4ft., Narrow weeper, medium green, USDA Hardiness Zone 4, In Garden Bed HR-R for 7.8 YEARS (HLG). Planted in 2012.\n\nAmerican Conifer Society: This cultivar is a graceful, strongly-weeping, narrowly-columnar tree that requires staking. From the point of the highest stake, the tree will “knuckle over” toward earth, establishing its maximum potential height. The branches droop vertically, parallel to the stem. The needles are a nice green color, growing on strong shoots and are often recurved. Be aware that in spring, in some growing regions, young shoots can be damaged by late frosts. Typical growth rate in most climates is 1 foot annually, producing a large weeping specimen, 8 feet tall by 4 feet wide (2.5 x 1.2 m) after ten years .\n\nLocation: Michigan State University, Hidden Lake Gardens, Tipton, MI.
