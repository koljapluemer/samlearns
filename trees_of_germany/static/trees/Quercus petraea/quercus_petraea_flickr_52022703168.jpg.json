    "description": "This oak was planted in 1939 to commemorate the 80th anniversary the city of Sacramento's foundation.  It was provided by the city of Kandern in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, John Sutter’s birthplace.  Folks looking into it determined that it is not native to southern Germany, and is a Quercus petraea (sessile oak).
