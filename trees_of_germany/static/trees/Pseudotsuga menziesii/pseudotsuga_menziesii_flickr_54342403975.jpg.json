    "description": "Abies lasiocarpa along the narrow gauge trail near the intersection with the Love Lane trail at south end of Crosscut Mountain Sports Center, east central Bridger Range, Gallatin County, Montana. Leaves flat and blunt tipped and that uniformly curve upward, have lines of resinous stomates on both surfaces, and that do not abscise from a woody pedicel (like spruce tree species do) are distinctive vegetative traits of Abies lasiocarpa. Generally smooth bark with horizontal sap lines and seed cones that by late summer are projected upward in an erect fashion are also distinction of this native conifer species. Abies lasiocarpa has terminal buds that are spherical in shape, which contrast to the sharp pointed terminal buds of Pseudotsuga menziesii.",
