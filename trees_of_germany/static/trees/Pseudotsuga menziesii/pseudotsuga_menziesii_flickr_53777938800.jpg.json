    "description": "Russet buffaloberry growing in mountain big sagebrush steppe and adjacent open dry understory of Yellowstone National Park about 8 miles east of Mammoth and to the north of the Grand Loop Road, Park County, Wyoming. In early season condition, russet buffaloberry is distinguished by opposite leaves and stems densely covered with scaly hairs that have either a silvery and rust coloration. This shrub is dioecious (male plants are shown here) and belongs to the Elaeagnaceae family, which are all nitrogen fixing via bacteria (Frankia) in root nodules. Russet buffaloberry currant is also common in the open dry understory of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).",
