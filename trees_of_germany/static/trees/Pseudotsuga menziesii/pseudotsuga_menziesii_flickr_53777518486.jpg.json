    "description": "Hookedspur violet growing in mountain big sagebrush steppe and adjacent open dry understory of Yellowstone National Park about 8 miles east of Mammoth and to the north of the Grand Loop Road, Park County, Wyoming. In early season condition, hookedspur violet is distinguished by spring flowering habit of bluish flowers with a well-developed spur, flowers born from short leafy stems, and a predilection to dry sites such as mountain big sagebrush steppe and open understory of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).",
