    "description": "Bearded fescue forms dense stands in the understory and open understory of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at the north end of the summit of Mount Ellis, Gallatin Range, Gallatin County, Montana. A profusion of broad lax stem leaves, few basal leaves, and a nodding inflorescences render this fescue morphologically distinctive among the native perennial fescue grasses (all of which have narrow erect to ascending leaves). Typically, bearded fescue grows in low density in dense understory vegetation but at this Mount Ellis site bearded fescue is abundant especially in the closed understory and on the shady north sides of forest edges. These dense stands of a broad lax-leaved grass might suggest the introduced smooth brome (Bromus inermis).",
