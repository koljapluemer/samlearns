    "description": "Wax currant locoweed growing in mountain big sagebrush steppe and adjacent open dry understory of Yellowstone National Park about 8 miles east of Mammoth and to the north of the Grand Loop Road, Park County, Wyoming. In early season condition, wax currant is distinguished by a spring flowering habit of mostly pinkish flowers, a showy tubular calyx that is conspicuously glandular hairy, and shallowly three-lobed to fan-shaped leaves with crenate margins that may also be glandular hairy (but sometimes sparsely so to even glabrous). Wax currant is also common in the open dry understory of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).",
