    "description": "Norway maple tree, as a street tree in Greendale, Wisconsin. Scientific name: Acer platanoides. Photo taken late October 2024. \n\nNorway maples have some of the largest leaves of the maple trees. They are sometimes confused with sugar maples (Acer saccharum). One distinguishing characteristic is that Norway maples have white sap in the leaf petioles, while sugar maples have clear sap. Other distinguishing features between Norway maples, sugar maples and silver maples can be found online.\n\nNorway maples are not native to North America and are now considered invasive in many areas; though often used as a street tree and landscaping tree.\n\nMaples are in the Sapindaceae (soapberry) family.",
